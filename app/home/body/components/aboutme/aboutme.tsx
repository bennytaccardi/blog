                    Hey folks! My name is Benny (Benito) Taccardi and I&apos;m a backend and full stack software engineer with a passion in learning new tech stuff.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Currently, I&apos;m involved in backend software engineering, at Unobravo, and I&apos;m using NodeJS. My main role is to develop complex cloud backend architectures using several AWS services.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Over the past years I worked on full stack systems using Java (SpringBoot), Python (FastAPI), Angular, React and Docker as technological stack.
